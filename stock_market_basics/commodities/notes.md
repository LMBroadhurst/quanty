# Commodities
Raw products such as Oil and Gold
Can be very volatile, especially in times of crisis
Can be complicated to invest & own, e.g. 100 Oz of Gold / Barrel of Oil
This is why we have CFDs or Futures contracts

## Why does the price of a commodity fluctuate?
Very similar to stocks, supply and demand.
Tend to follow a kind of random walk pattern trending upwards with inflation.

Futures contracts are used to try and negate against market volatility.
They negotiate the price for a future date, e.g. May 2024.

Futures markets list futures contract on given commodities, e.g. New York Mercantile Exchange.
Investors then use brokerage firm to buy and sell these commodity contracts.

Commodities are a great hedge against inflation, gold especially.

Can invest indirectly into commodities via shares in a gold mine, steel refinement, etc.
